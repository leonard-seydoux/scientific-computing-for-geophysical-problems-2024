# Scientific Computing for Geophysical Problems

<img src="illustration.png" />

## Description

The class _Scientific Computing for Geophysical Problems_ is a Master 2 course of the [institut de physique du globe de Paris](http://www.ipgp.fr/). The course is taught by [Alexandre Fournier](http://www.ipgp.fr/~fournier) and [LÃ©onard Seydoux](https://sites.google.com/view/leonard-seydoux/accueil). The goal of this course is to introduce students to the basics of scientific computing and to the use of Python for solving geophysical problems. The course mostly consists in practical sessions where students will learn how to use Python to solve geophysical problems, such as the propagation of seismic waves in the Earth or the analysis of geomatic data.

## Contents

The lecture slides are available in the [lectures](lectures/) folder. The corresponding notebooks are in the [notebooks](notebooks/) folder. These two folders will be updated as we advance. The solutions will also be published online.
